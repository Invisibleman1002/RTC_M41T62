This is a fork of JeeLab & Adafruit's real time clock library for Arduino modified to work with the ST M41T62 real time clock IC. Significant changes are to the square wave functions. See example sketches.

For details on using this library with an RTC module, see the guide at: https://learn.adafruit.com/ds1307-real-time-clock-breakout-board-kit/overview

To download. click the DOWNLOADS button to the right, and rename the uncompressed folder RTClib.

Place the RTClib folder in your *arduinosketchfolder*/libraries/ folder. 
You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE.
